# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

[05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler](https://timansy.github.io/05_homework/Docs/05/index.html)

## Object

The object for this project was to _create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day._

In order to do this, I needed to do a bit of brushing up on the mandated Moment.JS javascript library. I also needed to ensure that I was pushing content using jquery - which I have become quite familiar.

## Original User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Given Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
